# About Biorhythms
According to the theory, our lives are affected by three primary biorhythms: Emotional, Physical, and Intellectual. Others claim that there are additional secondary biorhythms (Spiritual, Intuition, Awareness, and Aesthetic) some of which may be combinations of the three primaries. Biorhythms start at birth and then oscillate between a positive phase and a negative phase throughout the lifetime.

Biorhythm supporters claim that when a biorhythm is at a positive phase, people may feel or be able to perform better for activities related to that biorhythm. Conversely, when a biorhythm is at a negative phase, a bad mood or difficulties to carry out activities related to that biorhythm may be experienced. When a biorhythm crosses the middle line it is considered to be in a “critical” time.
