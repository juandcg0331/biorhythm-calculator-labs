# About the repository

This repository is a laboratory for creating a training project. The goal of the project is to teach the student to work with dates and formatting patterns. The main idea is to create a calculator for calculating biorhythms. To find the most optimal solutions, we create and test individual components of the future system. We can combine, turn on and off individual components, creating and testing various options for a future project.
