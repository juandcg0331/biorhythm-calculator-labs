# Biorhythms Calculator

## About

This is a laboratory for creating a training project. The goal is to create a tutorial project on working with dates in Java. The idea is to create a biorhythm calculator that allows you to select dates and print reports for different periods of time. We use the laboratory to come up with what the project will look like, what components it will consist of.

## Stages

The project is divided into [eight stages](/src/main/java/lv/id/jc/biorhythm/stage). At each stage, the student will need to implement certain functionality. After completing the last stage, we should get a fully working program.
